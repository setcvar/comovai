```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/setcvar/comovai/main/main.lua"))()
```

If you want to customize it, fork it and make any change you want :) (i highly recommend having some basic Lua knowledge)

To change any settings edit "main.lua"
You can add new effects creating a new file on the "files" folder
